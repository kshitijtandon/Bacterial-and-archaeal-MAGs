## Genomic diversity and functional potential of coral skeltal microbiome 

This repository contains the scripts used to analyze data and create figures for the manuscript "Genomic view of the diversity and functional role of archaea and bacteria in the skeleton of the reef-building corals _Porites lutea_ and _Isopora palifera_"

Raw sequencing data are deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under BioProject PRJNA857095.

Complete workflow of this project and dataset has been made publicly available at [FIGSHARE](https://melbourne.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Genomic_view_of_archaeal_and_bacterial_diversity_in_skeleton_of_coral_Porites_lutea_and_Isopora_palifera/20364108)
